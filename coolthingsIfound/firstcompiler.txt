This seems like a chicken and egg problem. What came first ? 
Is it the compiler or the language ? 
The answer isn't very simple.
Assembly instructions are (generally) a direct mapping to opcodes, which are muti-bytes values of machine code which can be directly interpreted by processor. 
So I guess it's the language, because the code is directly being executed by the cpu.
